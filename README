This repository provides a Python package to make easy use of the _C_ommon-_N_earest-_N_eighbours cluster algorithm.
While the method can be applied to abitrary data, this implementation focuses on processing trajectories derived
from Molecular Dynamics simulations. In this context the cluster result can serve as a suitable basis for the
construction of a coreset Markov-state model to capture the essential dynamics of the underlying molecular processes.
